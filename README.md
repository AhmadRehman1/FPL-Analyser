# FPL Quant v2

Implementation of the frozen M0-M9 module specs (`FPL Quant v2`). This is a from-scratch
rebuild, separate from the prior attempt (`../fpl-quant-engine`), following the kickoff
notes' implementation order and the architectural corrections the spec-freezing process
converged on (versioned parameters, a real `evidence_claims` layer, MIQP not MILP, etc).

## Status

- **M0 (Data Schema & Ingestion Architecture): done.** Three-layer model
  (`fact_raw` -> `fact_reconciled` -> `evidence_claims`), generic versioned-parameter
  mechanism, `data_asof` snapshot discipline, deprecation allowlist (including M8's
  tab 31-36 addition), all built and tested against the real source data.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt

# Extract FPL-Core-Insights and place the evidence workbook under data/external/ first
# (see data/external/ layout below), then:
.venv\Scripts\python scripts\run_ingestion.py

.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Layout

```

                                  sources, generic param_versions mechanism, model_runs

                                  all-VARCHAR, append-only across ingestion runs

    params.py                 -- generic versioned-parameter read/write (immutable versions)

    snapshot.py                -- data_asof query helpers (look-ahead prevention)
    ingest_workbook.py         -- evidence workbook -> evidence_claims, deprecation allowlist

## Design notes worth knowing before touching this

- **`evidence_claims` matching is normalized, not literal-string.** The workbook spells
  player names differently than FPL-Core-Insights does (accents, dropped middle names).
  `player_alias.normalized_alias_name` is the join key; a word-subset fallback handles
  compound-surname mismatches (e.g. workbook's "Manuel Ugarte" vs the registered "Manuel
  Ugarte Ribeiro"), but only when it resolves to exactly one distinct player.
- **`matches.csv`'s `home_team`/`away_team` reference team `code`, not `id`**, despite the
  source README stating `id` -- verified against real data (Arsenal code=3/id=1 appears as
  `home_team='3.0'` in its own home fixture). `reconcile.py` joins on `code`.
- **Compound free-text evidence (6_Manager Database, 17_Pre-season Match Reports) is staged,
  not auto-decomposed.** Per M1b's frozen spec, decomposing a cell like "Alonso trialled
  4-2-3-1... gave minutes to academy players..." into atomic claims is a permanent
  human-curation step, not an NLP problem. Both tabs land in
  `claims_pending_manual_decomposition` with `raw_text` preserved for a human to work from.
- **Every module's versioned parameters share one physical table** (`param_versions`),
  distinguished by `param_family`. `claim_type_decay_params` and `source_tier_weights` are
  read-only views over it, named to match the spec docs exactly. `params.resolve_param()`
  hard-errors on a missing lookup -- it never silently falls back to a default (this is
  M5's explicit, non-negotiable requirement, generalized to the whole mechanism).
- **Superseded claims are excluded "outright" per M0's wording, but `snapshot.py` treats
  that as asof-relative**, not an unconditional filter -- otherwise a backtest run before a
  correction landed would incorrectly see no evidence at all, which is a real look-ahead
  bug, not a faithful reading of the spec's intent (M7 depends on this being right).
